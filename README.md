<p align="center"> <img src="screenshots/sprax_nav.gif" alt="Main Screen" width="400"/> </p>

**Sprax** is an Android app that helps German learners build vocabulary through a fun and interactive guessing game. Lessons are organized by level (A1‚ÄìB1), and the app includes pronunciation playback, progress tracking, quick reviews, and gradual learning ‚Äî all wrapped in a clean, user-friendly interface.

**This project showcases my journey into mobile development, applying theoretical knowledge into real-world app development.**

## ‚ú® Features

**Vocabulary Lessons** - Learn German vocabulary using flashcards with meanings, example sentences, images, and audio for pronunciation.

**Progress Tracking** - Track your known and unlearned words, with the option to reset lessons for further practice.
