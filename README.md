**Sprax** is an Android app designed to help German learners practice vocabulary with a fun, interactive guessing game. Lessons are categorized by levels (A1–B1), and the app features progression tracking, quick review, and gradual learning — all within a clean, simple UI.

**This project showcases my journey into mobile development, applying theoretical knowledge into real-world app development.**

## ✨ Features

**Vocabulary Lessons** - Learn German words in a flashcard style with meanings and example sentences.

**Progress Tracking** - Track your known and unlearned words, with the option to reset lessons for further practice.
